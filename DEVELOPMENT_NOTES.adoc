= Development Notes

== What's in the folder

* `package.json` -- the manifest file that declares the extension aspects
* `src/extension.ts` -- the extension's main file (with the `activate` function)
* `src/*.ts` -- secondary source code files
* `src/utils.ts` -- TBD

== Taking the Extension Out for a Spin

Press `F5` to open a new Code window with the extension loaded. 
(We'll call the original copy of VSCode the "dev" window.
We'll call the spawned copy of VSCode the "trial" window.)

* The extension runs in debug mode, so setting breakpoints, etc. works fine.
* `console.log()` and `console.error()` output goes to the "debug console" (dev window).
* A debugging toolbar pops up (dev window). For one thing, you can relaunch the extension from the debug toolbar after changing any source code.
* You can also use the reload command (`Ctrl+R`; trial window) to reload the extension.


== The API

* See `node_modules/@types/vscode/index.d.ts`.

== Run tests

* For this project, we're using `Jest` for the automated tests.
* Tests are locatated in the tests folder.
